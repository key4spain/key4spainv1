                    Most international buyers arrive in Spain with a list of online
                    listings, limited area knowledge, and no structured process. Key4Spain
                    works as a buyer-side advisory layer — helping clients understand what
                    they are looking at, what they are not seeing, and what needs to happen
                    before a decision is made.

                    The advisory covers the preparation and coordination stages of a
                    property search: area context, search structure, visit preparation, and
                    the right professional referrals at the right moment.
